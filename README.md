# PlotLocator

## Description

The Plot Locator App was created to help scientists, with or without GPS services, locate their plots in the field. The app creates an in-app searchable database that stores the study area name, GPS coordinates, date, site and plot numbers, and information about the plot location such as field notes and the number of steps and distance from landmarks. An optional GPS assist allows users to locate plots using GPS and provides GPS availability and accuracy information. A digital compass and Google Maps directions options provide users with additional location aids. Field data are saved as a CSV file on the user’s mobile device and can be saved externally. The user assumes all risk when using the Plot Locator App to collect and retrieve data (i.e., also use traditional methods until user is familiar with the app). 

## Requirements and Compatibility

The Plot Locator app is an Android app. Plot Locator can be used with Android versions 4.1 – 8+. To use the optional GPS function, Google Maps, and to save your CSV file externally, you will need access to GPS satellites, a cell tower, and/or Wi-Fi signal. The app requires that your device saves to an SD card or emulated SD card. It is recommended that you create a simple test file to determine if your device saves to the file location used in the Plot Locator app.
